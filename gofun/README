Dependencies:
-------------
To compile GoFun you need the Qt3 development packages.

Short install guide:
--------------------

Type the following commands:

#make -f Makefile.cvs
#./configure
#make
#su
#make install

It's possible that you have to
give following parameter to ./configure,

--with-qt-dir=/path/to/qtdir

because the configure script isn't able
to find the Qt directory on everysystem.

I wish you the best luck one can have.

Troubleshooting:
----------------
Should there occur problems don't fear
to drop me an email <tobi.web@gmx.de>.
